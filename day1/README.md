# Indroduction to CP2K day 1

## About this course

This course is designed to teach attendees how to run basic CP2K calculations and give them the key knowledge
required for doing so. It will cover the important  
options in the CP2K input file, before undergoing practical sessions on running 
CP2K simulations. 

We will also cover a selection of helpful tips and tricks, and where to find guidance and
help preparing input files

This course will assume no prior experiance of using CP2K or other atomistic simulation packages
however it also aim to be useful to a user with basic experienace.

While we will be referencing denisty functional theory and other theoretical methods understanding of these is not the principal aim of this course.
Our aim is to use these systems to help familiarise attendees with using CP2K to run simulations. 

* What can CP2K do
* Understanding the input file
* Input file preparation
* Running CP2K jobs and understanding the outputs
* Key parameters and ensuring accuracy
* Getting good performance
* Common pitfalls and problems
* How to start with your own simulations and where to find guidence
* Practicals: Energy miniminisation, geometry optimiation, molecular dynamics

## About CP2K

CP2K is a quantum chemistry and solid state physics software package that can perform
atomistic simulations of a wide variety of systems, ranging from solid state to biological systems.
CP2K provides a general framework for running density functional theory (DFT) simulations, with
extensions that enable users to run classical molecular dynamics (MD), mix MD and DFT to obtain
quantum-mechanical/molecular-dynamics (QM/MM) runs, or perform other forms of metadynamics, Monte Carlo, or other simulations.
